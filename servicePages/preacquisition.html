          <p>The RICS Building Survey is the most comprehensive report of its kind and should be used for larger or older properties, or when planning major works.
              The report provides an in-depth analysis of the property's condition and includes advice on defects, repairs and maintenance options.
              </p>
          <p>Building Surveys are recommended when purchasing a property, the main reasons for this is to safe guard your investment and give you reassurance the property you are buying is in a known state of repair.</p>
          <p>A mortgage valuation is not a survey. It is normally carried out by a surveyor appointed by the lender to confirm the property represent reasonable security against the money they are lending. A Building Survey or RICS Homebuyer will tell you about the condition and structure of a building. This is of paramount importance when you are purchasing property.</p>
          <p>The RICS Condition Report should be used for conventional house, flat or bungalow built from common building materials and in reasonable condition.</p>
          <p>Defect inspections and reports are often a requirement following damage to leasehold properties or where freeholders have been unable to satisfy their concerns over visible defects. It is important Clients understand how dеfесtѕ have occurred, their impact on the future use of the building and their cost for remedy.</p>
          <p>Buildings are made up of varied components which at first glance to the untrained eye may look structurally sound but could conceal defects. To avoid any nasty surprises it is best to have a better knowledge of the property condition.</p>
          <p>Home owners may undertake their own alterations, whether it's an extension or some internal alteration, without being aware of the structural implications. This could result in you having to incur additional cost to put things right on top of your purchase expenses. A survey carried out by a qualified property Surveyor will provide you with the advice you need to make an informed decision about the value and condition of your prospective new property.</p>
          <p>We recommend a Full Building Survey for properties older than 40-50 years old, over 100m2 and/or that have had modifications such as walls knocked down, extensions, loft conversions etc. or properties where you intend to make structural alterations.</p>
